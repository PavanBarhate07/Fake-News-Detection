# Fake-News-Detection

Overview:
This Python project aims to detect fake news using machine learning techniques. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, and model building, employing a PassiveAggressiveClassifier with TfidfVectorizer. The project is designed for simplicity and efficiency in distinguishing between real and fake news articles.

Features:
Data Exploration: Understand the dataset structure, examine label distribution, and explore text data characteristics.
Text Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess textual data, preparing it for model training.
Model Building and Training: Utilize a PassiveAggressiveClassifier with TfidfVectorizer for efficient model construction.
Confusion Matrix Evaluation: Assess model performance through a confusion matrix to analyze predictions.

Usage
1) Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/PavanBarhate07/Fake-News-Detection.git

2) Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3) Explore the Jupyter Notebook:
Open and run the provided Jupyter notebook (Fake_News_Detection.ipynb) for a step-by-step analysis of the project.

Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled statements categorized as real or fake news, along with additional metadata such as subject, speaker, and counts of truthfulness categories. The CSV file (train.csv) contains the raw data.
